    <h1>About Her:</h1>
        <p className="about-her-text">She is a kind and loving individual who I get to be lucky to call my girlfriend. 
            She is a 19 year old studying biology in university. She works at the Houston Zoo as a hostess for 
            the restaurants. Her beauty and love for the animals knows no bounds. On her freetime from working and studying, 
            she volunteers at animal shelters to help in any way she can. She is such an inspiring person. Who wouldn't want to be her. 
            She was also the head drum major for two years at the Raiders Drum and Bugle Corps.
